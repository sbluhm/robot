# Nav2 Minimal Turtlebot3 Simulation

This is a minimum simulation for the Turtlebot3 for use with Nav2. This is setup to strip out external dependencies and complexities to the bare minimum needed for simulating the robot for Nav2's bringup which hopefully will not require changes from distribution-to-distribution.
